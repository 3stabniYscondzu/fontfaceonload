The album title reflects B.o.B's idea of turning a negative situation into a positive one. In an interview with Genius.com, he explained: "To me 'Underground Luxury' is taking that which can be deemed as a miserable situation or that which somebody wouldn't want, and make it something luxurious." The album showcases B.o.B's versatility as an artist, blending different genres such as hip hop, pop, rock and R&B. The album also explores themes such as fame, money, love and spirituality.
 
The album received mixed reviews from critics, who praised B.o.B's charisma and production skills, but criticized his lack of originality and lyrical depth. The album debuted at number 22 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 35,000 copies in its first week. It also reached number 12 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 9 on the US Rap Albums chart. The album spawned four singles: "Headband", "Ready", "John Doe" and "We Still In This Bitch". The first three singles reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.
 
Underground Luxury is available for download and streaming on various platforms such as Qobuz[^1^], Genius[^2^] and SoundCloud[^3^].

The album's reception was not very positive among critics, who praised B.o.B's charisma and production skills, but criticized his lack of originality and lyrical depth. Rolling Stone gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5, saying that "tracks with Future and 2 Chainz highlight his limitations on the mic, and without the Dr. Luke-assisted buoyancy of 2012's Strange Clouds, the album falls flat" [^1^]. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, calculated an average score of 51 based on 6 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews" [^2^]. AllMusic also gave the album 3 stars out of 5, stating that "the puzzling Underground Luxury mixes mack daddy music with mall rat tracks, even if B.o.B's conviction throughout suggests he sees them as equals" [^3^].
